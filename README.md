# Chrome-Extensions
In this repository you will find the zipped file with all the files and images that came with the downloadable extension package originally (what was uploaded to the chrome store).
As well as the main source code that was worked on for this project (this is done so you don't have to download the full folder to view my code).
The purpose of this extension is to allow the user to access amazon services with just a click of the button.
